# Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in  Biological Sequence Design

This repository provided implemented codes for the paper -- Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in  Biological Sequence Design. 
> 

The codes are implemented our code based on [Proximal Exploration for Model-guided Protein Sequence Design](https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/proximal-exploration)
