# Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in  Biological Sequence Design

This repository provided implemented codes for the paper -- Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in  Biological Sequence Design. 
> 

Our codes are implemented based on
- Proximal Exploration for Model-guided Protein Sequence Design ([paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/ren22a.html), [code](https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/proximal-exploration))
- Biological Sequence Design with GFlowNets ([paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/jain22a/jain22a.pdf), [code](https://github.com/MJ10/BioSeq-GFN-AL))
